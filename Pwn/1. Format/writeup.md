# Echo
> Pwn - 100 pts

I've written a program to echo your input back at you. Just give it some input, and you get it right back. <br>

I wrote it in C with the formatted print function and I am very proud <br>

## Writeup 

folder -> Echo <br>
The program prompts for input and echoes it back at the user. <br>
The output is formatted and inserting a "%s" will output a string - the flag. <b>
FLAG: `UiTHack19{I_heard_you_wanted_a_string}`

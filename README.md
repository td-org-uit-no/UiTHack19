### Planning:

#### UiTHack 2019 - thoughts and challenges

###### Motivation and vision
We want to create more interest and enthusiasm for security and related problems for students. 
For this, a noob-friendly Capture-the-flag competition is perfect!
The idea is to expose people to gradually more challenging tasks, starting with very simple ones and moving to more complex ones. None should be too hard and some help will be given for those in need. 

##### Challenge Categories
We define the following categories of challenges, with a minimum of three(3) in each category and up to six(6).
###### Noob
- [X] Noob1
- [X] Noob2
- [X] Noob3
- [X] Noob4
- [ ] Noob5
- [ ] Noob6

###### Misc
- [ ] Have a flag "hidden" on the tdctl site? And mabye on the IFI Discord?
- [ ] Reactivate GLADoS to hand out a flag
- [ ] Up a flag to the IRC server
- [ ] Esoteric horrorshow?

###### Pwn


###### Reverse Engineering


###### Crypto
 
- [X] ceasar chipher, write in why we put what we put in terminal to solve rotation cipher?   
- [X] Mabye run base64 again? let the studentgets familiar witht he syntax. Can write more lines thats encrypted, so that the studentshave to decrypt multiple lines, and recognice the end of a base64 encrypted file '=='. Mabye takes this as the second task.
- [X] Hash password, normal encryption, with one ore two lettes over f in the encryptet text? These will ned to be removed before decryption can take place. Have this as the pasword for a steganography picture? Should this be under misc? 


###### Web
- [X] Easy get request of flag in URL
- [ ] Some forgotten password and username in source, different variations of this?
- [ ] As with the newsletter sites, maby have a "box" cover the actuall site where the flag is pictured? Manipulation of the source to remove?

### Planning:

#### UiTHack 2019 - thoughts and challenges

###### Motivation and vision
We want to create more interest and enthusiasm for security and related problems for students. 
For this, a noob-friendly Capture-the-flag competition is perfect!
The idea is to expose people to gradually more challenging tasks, starting with very simple ones and moving to more complex ones. None should be too hard and some help will be given for those in need. 

##### Challenge Categories
We define the following categories of challenges, with a minimum of three(3) in each category and up to six(6).
###### Noob


###### Misc
- [ ] Reactivate GLADoS to hand out a flag
- [ ] Up a flag to the IRC server
- [ ] Esoteric horrorshow?

###### Pwn


###### Reverse Engineering


###### Crypto
1. Mabye run base64 again? let the studentgets familiar witht he syntax. Can write more lines thats encrypted, so that the studentshave to decrypt multiple lines, and recognice the end of a base64 encrypted file '=='. Mabye takes this as the second task. 
2. ceasar chipher
3. Hash SHA256, normal encryption, with one ore two lettes over f in the encryptet text. These will ned to be removed before decryption can take place.

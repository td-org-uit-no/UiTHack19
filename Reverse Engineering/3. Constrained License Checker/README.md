# Constrained License Checker
> Reverse Engineering 500 pts

An intelligence source was able to find a password encrypted file along with an application
most likely used to confirm the validity of the password.

Sadly, we were not able to retrieve the source of the application, but we hope you can
reverse engineer the application for us and crack the encryption.

Best of luck!
